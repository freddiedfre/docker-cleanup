# Docker Cleanup Utility

A minimal, safe, and professional **Docker cleanup helper** for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Supports rootless Docker, rootful Docker Engine, and Docker Desktop.

---

## Features

- **Safe defaults**: removes unused containers, images, volumes, and networks
- **Full cleanup**: wipes everything except system defaults (`bridge`, `host`, `none`)
- **Rootless support**: auto-detects user socket
- **Tested**: comes with shell-based sanity checks
- **Bin helper**: run from anywhere with `bin/docker-cleanup`
